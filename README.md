# Javawow! New Java library for a friendly code

Working with Java 17

## What is Javawow?

Javawow is a Java library that allows you to write code in amore friendly
way. It's a library for new programmers, that are learning Java, but it can be used by anyone. 

## Objective

The main objective of Javawow is to help new programmers to learn Java more easily.
Create a libraries of a multiporpose methods, that can be used in any Java project.
Logic, Math, Geometry, Validation, Print, Loop, Tree, Text, Data, File, Connection, etc.
We're starting working now, so we havea lot of work to do.
New ideas are welcome. Feel free to contribute.

## We are studens learning Java. We are not experts, but we are trying to help new programmers.

# First package in the Library: br.pops

The package br.pops contains the first classes of the library. We try nomeclatures that can be easily understood by new programmers.
Our ideia is to work only one package, but we can change this in the future.


# First Class in the Library: Print

How to import the class:

```java  
import static br.com.javawow.lib.Print.*;

/**
 * For Java 17 
 */
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        print("Hello World!");
    }
}
```
# Print Class

The Print class provides a series of methods to print messages on the console. The main print method, which simplifies
the so controversial System.out.println, allows new programmers to print messages with a much simpler call.

We have many ideas to implement in this project, but we need your help.

Thanks for read this.
